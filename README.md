## An application that returns information about the map and weather of different cities including the cities’ popular places and landmarks.

### What problem does this application solve? (User Story)

As an user or a frequent traveller, I want the website to be able to find the map and weather for the next 5 days of any city.
The website should also be capable of adding any city or point of interests to the wish-list for future reference.  
Ideally, the user can also find useful and latest news and information about the city.

### The structure (Acceptance Criteria)

- The City Wonderer webpage includes a header with a dropdown wish-list;
- The webpage includes a search bar;
- The webpage has its custom designed logo;
- The user can select different categories of point of interests that they are interested;
- The user can type in the search bar and press on the search button to get results of a map and weather for the next 5 days of any city;
- The webpage includes styling in Bootstrap v4.6 as well as custom CSS;
- CSS display grid is essential for displaying the map, the weather information and point of interest of any city;
- The webpage uses Opensource map embedded (leafletjs.com) to display the city map and points of interest;
- The webpage fetches data using JQuery from two open source APIs: OpenTripMap and OpenWeather;
- The webpage includes JavaScript functions to render point of interests of a city on the map as well as in the side bar on the right;
- The webpage’s HTML follows a logical structure with semantic elements throughout the code; and
- The webpage is made responsive using Media Query in CSS stylesheet.
